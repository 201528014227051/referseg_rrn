# Referring Image Segmentation via Recurrent Refinement Networks

This is a rough version for [Referring Image Segmentation via Recurrent Refinement Networks](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Li_Referring_Image_Segmentation_CVPR_2018_paper.html), CVPR 2018. The clear one will be released shortly.

The code derives from [TF-phrasecut-public](https://github.com/chenxi116/TF-phrasecut-public) and contains some changes. The main difference lies in the DeepLab-ResNet backbone which comes from [tensorflow-deeplab-resnet](https://github.com/DrSleep/tensorflow-deeplab-resnet).
